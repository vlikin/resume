		\companyheader{Senior Drupal/PHP Developer}{Skelia}{August 2012 - August 2013}
		The company was specialized in sports coaching. I was responsible for supporting of the current state of code, fixing, developing new features. The project was built on Drupal 6 using another contribute modules. There were built a lot of custom modules that represented business processes managing different kinds of sport. I got the practice in cooperating with foreign customers. It made my English level higher. I traveled abroad for business.
		\\ \textbf{Results} \\
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The existed code base was modified.
			\item Doxygen's best practices were applied using D6+API modules that helped us to keep our code clean and documented.
	\item The sub-project "Monitoring" was developed. It contained many both front-end and back-end tasks, used different technologies separating and limiting
code from overlapping. We started to use SASS, Compass, CoffeeScript technologies. This project contained a lot of dynamic GUI elements with a lot of charts and backgroundn requests.
	\item The GUI import wizard was developed. It processed big amount of data. So we used such Drupal technologies as multi-page forms, Drupal cache, Batch API and
another features.
	\item Data synchronization between different companies project. It
uses another web-services to import data to our project to be up to
date(Guzzle).
	\item Own web services these allow another services to work with our
project. It is also a preparation for mobile version, and different mobile
applications(Drupal, Webservices, Oauth, Guzzle). \\

		I had been working as a Drupal developer for 5 monthes. The development process looked as a factory. Everybody had own responsibilities. We used Drupal 6 and the best practices that company had for this time. I was a developer in the team that supported “johnson and johnson” projects. It was a good example of corporate products, many small projects related with each other and based on common platform(Drupal multisiting, Aegir, another common performance technologies).I received the huge experience there: how
work in a team with separate responsibilities, control results. Responsibilities Drupal back-end developer, Integrating the ApacheSolr abilities \\
\textbf{Technologies}: PHP, MySQL, CSS, JavaSCript, PanelsEveryWhere, SCRUM.

 			\item[Document authorization process(C Sharp.Net, MS Word, MS Excel, VB scripts)] Project We had got a lot of reports that were getting ready to print] We needed the total and descriptive report analysis. The directory-document parser was created. It tried to find documents, parsed them, and got useful information
from. The intermedia data was stored into local database(xml), that converted data
to excel format that our customer had required before
			\item[X-ray data axiomatization in different hospitals] The client had the central database of clients and doctors (a simple drupal based site). There were a lot of hospitals(X-ray) around a state. X-Ray station produced client results in xml format. We created a watcher that automatically synchronized data with the central site, and sent the result data The client program was written using C Sharp.Net using FileWatching possibilities. On drupal site we used module services to communicate clients with the server. The protocol xml-rpc was used.
			\item[Simple information sites] - \\
				Joomla sites: http://acop.com.ua; http://dsaua.org \\
				Drupal sites: http://insurancefla.org; http://consultcneter.org \\

			\item[Black SEO] Many simple sites these promote another site. The sites are grouped by 5 sites(multisiting) in different shared hostings. To make them simple we used all contribute extensions themes, modules. We tried to not write custom code making it faster(development process) and cheaper. Used technologies: Aegir, multi-siting, Content types, Views, Panels, WebForm, pathauto, token, pagetitle, boost.
